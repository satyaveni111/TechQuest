        <h2>What is TechQuest</h2>
        <p>The TechQuest is a web based quiz system where students from ECE can attend the examination of the multiple choice questions.<br>In this platform they can also justify thenselves after giving the examination as the result will come after answering definite questions<br> for each set in each subject in each Domain.There is also an option for admin who can edit questions and answers.Moreover,the <br>admin can add or remove questions and can also remove a set.</p>

                The homepage introduces the website, its purpose, and benefits. Users can see a brief <br> description of what the platform offers, like quizzes on various ECE subjects, along with<br>a call-to-action (e.g., “Sign Up” or “Login to Start Quizzing”).The login page is designed <br>for simplicity  and user - friendliness, ensuring that users can quickly access  of account <br> with minimal friction. The page includes:  Name & Email.  If the email related to RGUKT<br> mail then the user can access to start  further process, otherwise user not allow to take<br>quiz.  After successfully logging in, user are teken to adomain selection page. The page<br> includes list of ECE domains. Once a domain is selected, there are presented with the<br>subdomains related to that topic. After selecting the subdomain, users are promted to<br> choose the difficulty level of the quize. There are levels of basic, medium, hard. Once <br>difficulty level selected , the quize begins and user presented with series of questions<br> with some time limit. Ater answering all questions or out-off time, users are ended with <br>scorecard to summarizing their performance.
